#  Cat Finder With Machine Learning

Cat Finder is an app that allows anybody to choose a best cat breed with Machine Learning.

- Table View with convenient acess to all cat breeds
- Smart finder system that uses Sklearn model that was ported to CoreML
- Uses a cat API to get all breeds and cat description

#Warning 
- The ML model is trained on an extremely small dataset(consists of life-span, intelligence, and energy level) thus needs more data and training. 
To see how I trained a model in python see the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FEJMZTe33hmCsfDtIdlsHYXbJXafzLys?usp=sharing)
